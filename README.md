# Hello! I'm Nick J Lyon (they / them)
 
## Welcome!
  
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an early career data scientist with significant ecology experience that I am currently applying at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). Check out my website ([njlyon0.github.io](https://njlyon0.github.io/)) and public repositories for examples of my work. I am also moderately active on Twitter ([scilyon](https://twitter.com/scilyon)).
